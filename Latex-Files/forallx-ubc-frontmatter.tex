Jonathan Ichikawa, who modified the Magnus edition to create this version, would, first and foremost, like to thank P.D.\ Magnus. He is also grateful to Greg Restall, and his book \emph{Logic}, which is the first text he taught from and which is the model for the discussion of trees. He also thanks the many UBC students who test-drove drafts of the book. He's also grateful for helpful conversations with Roberta Ballarin, Roy Cook, Josh Dever, Dave Gilbert, Thony Gillies, and Jon Shaheen.

The original author, P.D.\ Magnus, would like to thank the people who made this project possible. Notable among these are Cristyn Magnus, who read many early drafts; Aaron Schiller, who was an early adopter and provided considerable, helpful feedback; {and} Bin Kang, Craig Erb, Nathan Carter, Wes McMichael, Selva Samuel, Dave Krueger, Brandon Lee, Toan Tran, and the students of Introduction to Logic, who detected various errors in previous versions of the book.
