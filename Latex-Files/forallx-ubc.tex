% So hi! This is Jonathan. I am making this source code available, for others to modify if they like. But if you're someone who knows your way around LaTeX, I probably need to apologize to you, because I don't really know what I'm doing with a lot of this code. I'm sure I've hacked some things in pretty bad ways, and I'm sorry. I've also forgotten how I made a lot of things work. Feel free to email me with a question if you want, that's ichikawa@gmail.com, but it's possible that I'm not going to know the answer to your question. I literally learned to use LaTeX by looking at Magnus's source code. Sorry.

% Note that you may need to compile the file 2-3 times for all of the links between sections to work properly. In particular, the links in the subsections of the solution key
% tend to require the document to be compiled multiple times.  

% This automatically moves the PDF file up a directory when compiled. See pdflatex.py for a full description.
