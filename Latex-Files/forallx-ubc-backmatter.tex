In the Introduction to his volume \emph{Symbolic Logic}, Charles Lutwidge Dodson advised: ``When you come to any passage you don't understand, \emph{read it again}: if you \emph{still} don't understand it, \emph{read it again}: if you fail, even after \emph{three} readings, very likely your brain is getting a little tired. In that case, put the book away, and take to other occupations, and next day, when you come to it fresh, you will very likely find that it is \emph{quite} easy.''

\medskip

The same might be said for this volume, although readers are forgiven if they take a break for snacks after \emph{two} readings.
